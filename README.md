# Error Autopsy CLI
> A tool for high-performance students to analyze exam errors, understand their own patterns, and optimize study routines.

## Why?
The best strategy to achieve top grades isn't just to study hard, but to study smart and optimize your time.

**Error Autopsy** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to track, categorize, and analyze mistakes made in mock exams. By shifting the focus from the score you got to *why* you lost those points, this tool provides data-driven insights to fix the root cause of academic gaps.

## Features
- **Smart Logging:** Categorizes errors into 5 distinct psychological/technical types:
   1. Content Gap
   2. Attention Detail
   3. Time Management
   4. Fatigue
   5. Interpretation

- **Data Persistence:** Uses local JSON storage to keep a historical log of performance.
- **Analytics:** Generates reports showing error distribution.
